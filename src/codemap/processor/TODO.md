- let the commit command operate on git diffs as it's already doing. No need to integrate with processor
- remove lsp entirely too complicated to maintain.
- use tree-sitter to generate metadata on the file level not on the chunk level, cache this data and keep updating it every time any codemap cmd is called.
- remove the git analysis to make the data even simpler.
