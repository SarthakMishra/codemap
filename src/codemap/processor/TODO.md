- let the commit command operate on git diffs as it's already doing. No need to integrate with processor
- remove lsp entirely too complicated to maintain.
- use tree-sitter to generate metadata on the file level not on the chunk level.
- remove the git analysis to make the data even simpler.
- remove the db, directly use tree-sitter for the analysis and generation.
- create a LOD (level of detail) implementation, instead of chunking. [LOD1(just the entity names in files), LOD2(entity with doc strings), ...]
- remove caching implementation, calculate everything on call.
