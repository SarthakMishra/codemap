# Development Environment Enhancement Plan

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current development environment has basic testing and linting setup but lacks:
- Comprehensive multi-version testing
- Advanced static code analysis
- Strict type checking
- Automated code quality enforcement
- Standardized pre-commit validation

## Enhancement Goals

1. **Multi-Version Testing**
   - Implement tox for testing across Python versions
   - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.8+ environments
   - Create standardized test environments

2. **Static Code Analysis**
   - Implement radon for code complexity metrics
   - Set up cyclomatic complexity thresholds
   - Monitor maintainability index

3. **Linting Improvements**
   - Increase strictness of ruff configuration
   - Enhance pylint rule enforcement
   - Standardize code style requirements

4. **Type Checking**
   - Make pyright configuration stricter
   - Enforce complete type annotations
   - Implement runtime type validation

5. **Pre-commit Integration**
   - Set up pre-commit hooks
   - Automate formatting and validation
   - Prevent non-compliant code from being committed

6. Add licensing comments
